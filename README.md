# AI Trainer Project

In this repo,  we employ a pose estimation module to track movements of the body. This is one of the applications of pose estimation module.

Using any three landmarks we can find the angle between them. Depending upon the angle at the moment we can determine how well a person is training.

In the example, we have considered hand exercise and we count the number of curls a person has completed. We have also added a bar to calculate the accuracy of the exercise.
